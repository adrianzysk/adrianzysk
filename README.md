### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Adrian Zysk!

I am a junior web developer. Since 2015 programming is my hobby. I finished studies in the field of computer science. Mainly I'm interested in web applications especially front-end. I would like to participate in projects that will teach me something new. I'm open to new technologies and i wish to gain more experience. I constantly develop my skills and learn quickly.
